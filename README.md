## Credit Default Risk Mitigation
OVERVIEW
This project focuses on credit default risk mitigation in credit card applications, emphasizing the identification of clients with potential payment difficulties. Using advanced analytical techniques and machine learning algorithms, the study aims to enhance financial risk management through data-driven insights.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of credit default among clients, allowing financial institutions to make informed lending decisions and reduce financial losses.

METHODOLODY
>> Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Standardized numerical variables for optimal model performance.
>> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed key trends in client demographics and payment history.
Visualized relationships between credit variables and default likelihood.
>> Feature Engineering
Created meaningful features (e.g., payment-to-income ratios, credit utilization).
Selected top predictors using correlation analysis and feature importance.
>> Model Development
Implemented and compared multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize predictive accuracy and interpretability.
>> Visualization and Insights
Integrated model outputs into Tableau dashboards for interactive exploration.
Delivered actionable insights to improve credit risk policies.

KEY FEATURES
Comprehensive end-to-end data science workflow.
Machine learningâ€“based risk scoring for credit applicants.
Tableau dashboard integration for real-time risk tracking.
Emphasis on explainability and transparency in model outputs.

TECH STACK

RESULTS AND INSIGHTS
Achieved a robust model with strong predictive performance (e.g., high AUC and F1-score).
Identified key drivers of default risk such as payment delays, credit utilization, and income-to-loan ratio.
Provided actionable insights for targeted interventions and better risk segmentation.
